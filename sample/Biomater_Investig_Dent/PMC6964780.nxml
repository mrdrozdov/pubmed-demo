The recent trend shows restorative resin composites that are user-friendly while either maintaining sufficient mechanical properties or with claimed bioactivity.</p><p>A relatively recent development is ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative (Pulpdent Corporation, Watertown, MA), a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) which the manufacturer states to be enhanced with &#x02018;rubberized&#x02019; resin. Earlier work has investigated some properties of interest of this material: flexural strength was shown to be similar to that of flowable and bulk-fill resin composites [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and significantly greater than that of other RMGIC [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. High fracture toughness was observed compared to compomers and RMGIC [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Wear was reported to be similar to that of a resin composite [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], although the material&#x02019;s compromised hardness suggests the importance of using an abrasive-resistant resin composite as coverage [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The promising mechanical behavior somewhat diverted research from other relevant properties, such as the claimed bioactivity and self-adhesion.</p><p>Considering the fact that ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative is a RMGIC, self-adhesion to the hard dental tissues would be anticipated. Nevertheless, a very high initial failure rate of restorations made with ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative was recently reported in a 1-year clinical follow-up of posterior restorations in adults [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The main reasons for failure described in this randomized study were a high incidence of loss of restorations, post-operative sensitivity and secondary caries [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is therefore important to investigate this material&#x02019;s quality of bond and ability to provide good cavity seal, both factors of relevance for the material&#x02019;s performance [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Whereas an almost intact interface was registered for ACTIVA BioACTIVE when the restoration was not challenged [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], conference abstracts and reports have hinted that marginal adaptation of ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative could be problematic [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies reported overall higher microleakage of cavities restored with ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative if no previous etching was performed nor an adhesive applied, compared to cavities restored with resin composite [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The laboratory and clinical findings indicate that the self-adhesive ability of ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative is not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate, <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>, the adhesion, marginal adaptation and volumetric contraction of the claimed bioactive restorative material (ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative) in comparison to a RMGIC and a resin composite.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>An overview of the study groups is shown in <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

Clamping the tooth to the mould ensured that the restorative material did not extend outside the area limited by the mould&#x02019;s orifice.</p><p>In restorations made with ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative and Fuji II LC, the enamel and dentine either: (a) did not receive any pretreatment or (b) were previously etched for 10&#x02009;s (as per manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions at the start of this study). In the latter case, enamel and dentine were etched with 38% phosphoric acid (Top Dent Etch Gel, DAB Dental A.B., V&#x000e4;sby, Sweden) prior to restoration with ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative and with 10% polyacrylic acid (Dentin Conditioner, G.C.

Thereafter, the directly opposite margin was also assessed and any gap present there was measured. Considering the total gap measured linearly from both opposing margins, wall-to-wall contraction of the restoration was calculated as a percentage of the cavity diameter [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><fig id="F0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Box-plot for shear bond strength (MPa) of the restorative materials according to pretreatment of enamel after thermocycling and storage for 28&#x000a0;days.

ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative showed the highest contraction followed by Fuji II LC. The lowest contraction was measured for Ceram X Mono (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0011"><title>Discussion</title><p>This laboratory study addressed properties relevant to the clinical use and performance of ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative, a restorative material with claimed bioactivity. In this study, when ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative was placed directly without pretreatment of the hard dental tissues, most restorations were lost. Due to the flat surfaces used for shear bond strength testing, the loss of restorations was already noted immediately after fabrication of specimens or during thermocycling. These findings contradict the self-adhesion capability claimed by the manufacturer, who promises &#x02018;a strong resin-hydroxyapatite complex and a positive seal against microleakage&#x02019; [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. When the material was applied in hemi-spherical cavities, restorations were retained to cavities with margins in enamel despite the lack of surface pretreatment. On the contrary, restorations placed in non-pretreated cavities with margins in dentine were lost due to poor adhesion combined with large volumetric contraction of ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative.</p><p>In this laboratory study, it was possible to assess the results on enamel and dentine separately. In clinical practice, most cavities show a combination of enamel and dentine margins. This fact in combination with the self-retentive configuration of most cavities after caries excavation and preparation can explain why the loss of restorations is not more frequently encountered. However, in a recent randomized clinical trial of Class I and II restorations using ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative, one of the main reasons for failure was loss of the restoration, followed by post-operative sensitivity and secondary caries, all indicating insufficient adhesion of the material [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The clinical behavior of ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative using only phosphoric acid as pretreatment was shown to be catastrophic with a very high annual failure rate of 24%. The excessive number of failures occurred in spite of the long familiarization process of the operator with the material before the start of the study, the fact that retentive cavities were prepared, and that the material was used following the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] at the time [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In the instructions for use of ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative as per September 2017, the tooth surface should be etched for 10&#x02009;s with phosphoric acid prior to insertion of the restorative material [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. According to our results, however, the use of phosphoric acid alone is not sufficient to ensure adhesion to dentine; this became evident by the loss of restorations. Only by applying the self-etch adhesive was it possible to retain ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative &#x02013; and result in shear bond strengths similar to those of the control (resin composite restorations) in both enamel and dentine. In November 2017, the manufacturer recommends to &#x02018;use a bonding agent in non-retentive cavity preparations&#x02019; [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. After discussions with the manufacturer regarding the poor adhesive ability of the material from our clinical and laboratory findings, the authors were pleased to see that the use of an adhesive (type not specified) was included in the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions for use as per March 2019 [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Our findings corroborate those of Omidi et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Kaushik and Yadav [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], who employed microleakage as a means of assessing marginal integrity and cavity seal. In both these previous studies, significantly higher dye penetration was observed when ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative was used without previous phosphoric acid etching and use of adhesive. In the latter as well as in the present study, only when adhesive was applied was microleakage similar to that of restorations made with a resin composite &#x02013; though these results depended on the employed adhesive [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Their results seem to be contradicted by the &#x0003e;99% intact margins reported by Hughes et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], measured approximately 1&#x02009;h after placement of restorations ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative. Whereas the present study also found a more positive picture for ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative immediately after placement of the restorations, these results deteriorated after thermocycling and storage. This deterioration is likely due to the development of contraction stresses resulting from continued polymerization reaction in combination with thermal stresses induced by thermocycling, stresses which could not be compensated for. On the other hand, the reduction in wall-to-wall contraction for Fuji II LC and Ceram X Mono after storage for 28&#x000a0;days can be explained by the lower contraction stresses in both of these materials in combination with water sorption, which partly compensated for the size of the gap. Since the exact composition of ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative is not disclosed, it is difficult to discuss why this material does not perform as the manufacturer claims or why it differs from the other investigated RMGIC (Fuji II LC).</p><p>In the present study, the use of the self-etch adhesive prior to restoration with ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative resulted in comparable marginal adaptation with that of control composite restorations, as observed by Kaushik and Yadav [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative still showed high wall-to-wall contraction in restorations with enamel margins. Additionally, the contraction measured for ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative in our study was significantly higher (median 2.9%) than that reported by the manufacturer (i.e. 1.7%) [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In fact, a concave surface visible to the naked eye could be noted on restorations made with ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative immediately after light-curing, resulting in polymerization stresses that can in part explain debonding. The unsatisfactory performance of the material observed <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>, in spite of following the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations at the time of initiating the study, is alarming. This is aggravated when considering the climbing sales worldwide and consecutive product awards that ACTIVA BioACTIVE Restorative has received in 2016, 2017 and 2019 [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The present results should be used constructively to enforce a more thorough testing of dental materials prior to launching onto the market and to regulate marketing claims that lack supporting evidence [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additionally, our findings recommend a more critical assessment from dental professionals when presented with newer, &#x02018;marvellous&#x02019; solutions. The claimed bioactive potential of depositing hydroxyapatite in the occurrence of gaps at the tooth-restoration interface is not yet made available and the confirmation of the latter claim is hereby challenged by the findings of this study. Moreover, any adhesive applied on the cavity walls may be a barrier for the suggested bioactivity of the material.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM7292"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="IABO_A_1696202_SM7292.docx" orientation="portrait" id="d37e154" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was part of the research traineeship of Stavroula Michou, funded by the Erasmus+ EU Programme, European Commission.
